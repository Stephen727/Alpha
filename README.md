OUTDATED (Working on updating file, play game for mini tutorial)!

My attempt to clone a text-based version of a game called RuneScape.

Controls:
Inventory: u = use, d = drop, s = swap
  -example: 1u (use slot one; depends on item) or 1s3 (swap slot 1 and 3), or 5d (drop item in slot 5)
 0 is back
 
 Equipment: Shows current bonuses, select slot to unequip items
 
 Melee: Attack with fists or a melee weapon
 Range: Equip bow and arrows, each shot consumes an arrow but player has chance to pick back up
 Prayer: Select  prayer to toggle, gives bonuses (lookup OSRS Prayer to get a better idea)
 Magic: Similar to prayer, toggle spell to autocast (requires runes)

Current Features
  Finished Skills: Hitpoints, Attack, Strength, Defense, Ranged, Prayer, Magic, Slayer
  Planned Skills: Woodcutting, Fletching, Fishing, Cooking, Mining, Smithing, Herblore, Crafting, Runecrafting

  Combat: Melee, Ranged, and Magic combat styles
          -Weapons have attack speeds and can be two-handed
          -Ranged: Use of arrows/bolts with bows/crossbows, thrown weapons
          -Magic: Uses runes to cast spells, some spells require certain staves to be held
          
  Slayer: Player assigned tasks to kill certain number of monsters
          -Slayer Monsters: Require slayer level and proper gear to be able to fight
          
  Prayer: Experience gained through burying bones
           -Auras provide player with combat bonuses in fights, slowly drain over time
           
  Consumeables: Player can boost stats by drinking potions and heal by eating food
            -Players get an attack delay added to them for consuming food/potions
