# Alpha
My attempt to clone a text-based version of a game called RuneScape.

Controls:
Inventory: [u] = use, [d] = drop, [s] = swap, [f] = fletch, [c] = craft
  -example: 1u (use slot one; depends on item) or 1s3 (swap slot 1 and 3), or 5d (drop item in slot 5)
 [0] is back/exit
 
Combat:
  Melee - One handed and two handed weapons. Weapons have different skill requirements, bonuses and attack speeds.
  Ranged - Thrown and shot weapons. Throwing knives, shortbows, and crossbows. Different arrow/bolt requirements.
  Magic - Requires runes to cast spells. Alchemy turns items into gold. Conversion converts bones into peaches. Smite requires the "God Staff" to cast. Magic Dart requires a slayer staff to cast.
  Prayer - Bury bones for experience or offer them at the temple. Select auras to use for increased bonuses or protection.
  
Skilling:
  Woodcutting - Chop down trees for logs that can be flecthed.
  Fletching - Flecth logs into bows, pick flax and spin them into bow strings. Make arrows or bolts with feathers.
  Fishing - Fish for raw food that can be cooked later.
  Cooking - Cook foods that you have caught fishing, and then eat them in combat to heal some hitpoints.
  Mining - Mine ores to be used for smithing.
  Smithing - Smelt metal ores into metal bars. Smith weapons and armors from metal bars with a hammer at the anvil.
  Herblore - Brew potions with vials, herbs and other ingredients to boost stats temporarily.
  Crafting - Tan hides into leather and craft ranged armor. Make amulets out of gems and gold.
  Runecrafting - Turn rune essence into runes that can be used to train magic.
  Slayer - Get tasks to kill monsters for experience and points that can be spent at a special shop. Some monsters have slayer level requirements and drop unique items.
  
Menu:
  Cities -  Each city has a unique set of dungeons.
  Dungeons - Each dungeon has a unique set of npcs.
  Shops - Shops can buy or sell items to the player.
  Bank - Withdraw or deposit items here.
  
Upcoming:
  Currently working on adding in mini-games and boss battles. Few other things planned but I am still working out the details on how they will be implemented.
